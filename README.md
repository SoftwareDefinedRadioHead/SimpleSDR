## Project Overview

SimpleSDR is a software-defined radio inspired by the project FreeRSP (http://electronics.kitchen/misc/freesrp/). It consists of a printed circuit board with a radio transceiver IC, and an FPGA with digital signal processing functionality. The FPGA acts as a signal processing back-end, while the circuit board is the front-end. 

## Educational Value Added

This is my first ever electrical engineering project, giving me my first taste of hands-on mixed-signal circuit design. SimpleSDR is a very ambitious first project, since it draws advanced conceptual knowledge from upper-level undergraduate EE courses, such as Signals and Systems and Intro to Communication Systems. Through hands-on design and engineering, I'll become familiarized with practices such as PCB design and FPGA programming. I expect this project to be a significant challenge, and take at least a year for me to complete. 

## Tasks

1. Install Altima Designer
2. STUDY THE SCHEMATICS and understand how an SDR works
3. Design my own SDR schematic
4. Design a PCB based on my SDR
5. To be continued...
